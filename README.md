# Verification-of-UART-Protocol-in-UVM

• A UVM based verification environment was created to verify the working of the UART Protocol.
• Developed a Clock Generator IP to produce clock pulses for a range of Baud Rates – 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400 & 57600.
• System has a configurable Parity Bit and type. The following testcases were verified – Random baud with single/double stopbit.
variable baud with Varying length and parity.
